# Gmail-Automation-
This script connects to Gmail's SMTP server, logs into the specified email account, composes a simple email with a subject and body, and sends it to a list of recipients. Be cautious with credentials and consider security best practices, such as using application-specific passwords and ensuring that sensitive information is not hardcoded in your script. Additionally, when sending emails via Gmail using less secure apps, you may need to enable access to less secure apps in your Google Account settings. Alternatively, consider using OAuth 2.0 for a more secure approach.
